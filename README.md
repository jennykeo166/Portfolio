# Portfolio

Welcome to my **Bioinformatics Portfolio** 👩‍💻  

This repository showcases my independent projects in RNA-Seq analysis, differential gene expression, and machine learning using R. Each project is organized into its own folder with R scripts, results, and documentation.

## 📂 Projects
- **01 Gene Expression (Exploratory Analysis)**  
  Normalization of RNA-Seq count data, PCA, clustering, and heatmaps using R.  

- **02 Differential Gene Expression (DGE)**  
  Applied **DESeq2** to identify differentially expressed genes, created volcano plots, MA plots, and functional enrichment visualizations.  

- **03 Machine Learning (in R)**  
  Implemented classification models in R to predict sample groups based on expression data.  

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- **R Packages:** DESeq2, ggplot2, pheatmap, EnhancedVolcano  
- **Analysis:** RNA-Seq exploratory analysis, differential gene expression, reproducible workflows  
- **Visualization:** PCA, clustering heatmaps, volcano plots, MA plots
